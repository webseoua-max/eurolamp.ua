== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WC Ukr Shipping” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found it you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here.

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== External services ==

This plugin uses SmartyParcel API to provide advanced logistic functions (like create labels, tracking etc.) and also external API to collect user feedbacks ([Privacy Policy](https://smartyparcel.com/privacy/)).
